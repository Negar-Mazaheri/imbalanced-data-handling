# Imbalanced Data Handling Project
This project implements various techniques to handle imbalanced datasets, focusing on improving model performance and ensuring balanced predictions for real-world applications. The techniques applied include undersampling, oversampling, ensemble methods, and threshold moving.
## Techniques Used
* **Undersampling:** Reduces the size of the majority class to match the minority class.
* **Oversampling:** Increases the size of the minority class by duplicating samples.
* **Ensemble Methods:** Combines multiple models to improve the prediction accuracy.
* **Threshold Moving:** Adjusts decision thresholds to improve classification performance on imbalanced data.
## Dataset: Lung Cancer Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Lung Cancer Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/lung-cancer). It contains data about lung cancer patients, including features such as age, gender, and results from medical tests. The dataset is imbalanced, with a higher number of cancer cases compared to non-cancer cases, making it an ideal candidate for testing imbalanced data handling techniques.
## Tools and Libraries Used
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization, including plotting graphs to compare performance metrics.
* **Imbalanced-learn:** For resampling techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
 ## Evaluation
 The project includes performance metrics and visualizations to compare the effectiveness of each technique on the imbalanced dataset.
